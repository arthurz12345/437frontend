This was a project I created for a class CSC 437 - Dynamic Web Development. It is a simple note taking app with the quirk that it looks like a sheet of lined paper, and the text all lines up with those lines. It features a front end created with the Lit framework, while the backend uses Express and is connected to a MongoDB database. It features a login system, light/dark mode, and a basic text editor to create and delete notes.  It can be found at:
